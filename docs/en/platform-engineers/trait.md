# Trait Definition

In the following tutorial, you will learn about definition objects with [KubeWatch](https://github.com/wonderflow/kubewatch) as example.

> This is a fork because we make it work as CRD controller. So user could use CRD(`kubewatches.labs.bitnami.com`) to describe K8s resources they want to watch including any types of CRD.

## Step 1: Create Trait Definition

To register [KubeWatch](https://github.com/wonderflow/kubewatch) as a new trait in KubeVela,
the only thing needed is to create an `TraitDefinition` object for it.
A full example can be found in this [kubewatch.yaml](https://github.com/oam-dev/catalog/blob/master/registry/kubewatch.yaml).
Several highlights are list below.

### 1. Describe The Trait Usage

```yaml
...
  name: kubewatch
  annotations:
    definition.oam.dev/description: "Add a watch for resource"
...
```

We use label `definition.oam.dev/description` to add one line description for this trait.
It will be shown in helper commands such as `$ vela traits`.

### 2. Register API Resource

```yaml
...
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: kubewatches.labs.bitnami.com
...
```

This is how you register Kubewatch's API resource (`kubewatches.labs.bitnami.com`) as the Trait.


KubeVela uses Kubernetes API resource discovery mechanism to manage all registered capabilities.


### 3. Configure Installation Dependency

```yaml
...
  extension:
    install:
      helm:
        repo: my-repo
        name: kubewatch
        url: https://wonderflow.info/kubewatch/archives/
        version: 0.1.0
        ...
```

The `extension.install` field is used by KubeVela to automatically install the dependency (if any) when the new workload
type added to KubeVela. The dependency is described by a Helm chart custom resource.
We highly recommend you to configure this field since otherwise,
users will have to install dependencies like this kubewatch controller manually later to user your new trait.

### 4. Define Workloads this trait can apply to

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  appliesToWorkloads:
    - "*"
...
```

A trait can work on specified workload or any kinds of workload, that deponds on what you describe here.
Use `"*"` to represent your trait can work on any workloads. 

You can also specify the trait can only work on K8s Deployment and Statefulset by describe like below:

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  appliesToWorkloads:
    - "deployments.apps"
    - "statefulsets.apps"
...
``` 

### 5. Define the field if the trait can receive workload reference

```yaml
...
spec:
  workloadRefPath: spec.workloadRef
...
```

Once registered, the OAM framework can inject workload reference information automatically to trait CR object during creation or update.
The workload reference will include group, version, kind and name. Then, the trait can get the whole workload information
from this reference.

With the help of the OAM framework, end users will never bother writing the relationship info such like `targetReference`.
Platform builders only need to declare this info here once, then the OAM framework will help glue them together.

### 6. Define Template

```yaml
...
    template: |
      outputs: kubewatch: {
        apiVersion: "labs.bitnami.com/v1alpha1"
        kind:       "KubeWatch"
        spec: handler: webhook: url: parameter.webhook
      }
      parameter: {
        webhook: string
      }
 ```

This is a CUE based template to define end user abstraction for this workload type. Please check the [templating documentation](../cue/trait.md) for more detail.

Note that in this example, we only need to give the webhook url as parameter for using KubeWatch.

## Step 2: Register New Trait to KubeVela

As long as the definition file is ready, you just need to apply it to Kubernetes.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oam-dev/catalog/master/registry/kubewatch.yaml
```

And the new trait will immediately become available for developers to use in KubeVela.
It may take some time to be available as the dependency (helm chart) need to install.

## Step 3: Verify

```bash
$ vela traits
"my-repo" has been added to your repositories
Successfully installed chart (kubewatch) with release name (kubewatch)
Automatically discover capabilities successfully âœ… Add(1) Update(0) Delete(0)

```
